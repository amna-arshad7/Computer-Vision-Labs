# Computer-Vision-Labs
This repository is a curated collection of all my weekly Computer Vision lab tasks and solutions from my 7th semester at university. Each lab focuses on hands-on learning with core CV concepts such as image processing, feature extraction, object detection, segmentation, and more — building a strong bridge between theory and real-world applications.
